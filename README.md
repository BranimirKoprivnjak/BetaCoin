# About

Beginner friendly Cryptocoin portfolio tracker. Currently only available
as web app for desktops/laptops.

## Todos:

- optimize components reevaluation
- flickering on fast scrolling though cryptos in dashboard, maybe issue with css?, some images trigger whole container to position differently?
- make chartjs responsive - https://itnext.io/a-fully-responsive-chart-js-chart-91a72ef5e2c
- formatNumber func should have a all case return statement
- chart-helpers, draw vertical annotation, fix problems with types
- add error handling if certain data about crypto is not available
